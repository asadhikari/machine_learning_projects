finding_donors
The aim of this project is to utilize supervised machine learning algorithms to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause.
I explore using Random forest, Gradient Boosting Classifiers and Logistic Regression and determine that Gradient boosting classifier is the best model.
Lastly, I run grid search to optimize the model and determine the top 5 predictive features.
